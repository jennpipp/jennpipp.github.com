       		<h2>Visual Artist R. V. Speck</h2>
       			<p> Julie 35 saw a piece of art by R. V. Speck at a local coffee shop, and looked them up on their laptop while they had their coffee. She wanted to know more about the artists work (background and artist statement). She liked the piece she saw but it was not for sale. Julie collects local art and wanted to look through an online gallery for apiece she could purchase. She was curious about the price range and size. She was wondering if there was a way to pay online, by credit card, or via an etsy site. She also interested in knowing if R. V. Speck had work up in other galleries.

       			<p> Jeff 42 received a business card from R. V. Speck a week ago. He dosen't have a ton of time but likes to take a quick peek at everyone’s work that stops by. He wanted to look through her paintings and see a range of her current work. He also wanted to know where she has shown recently. Jeff was curios what the size of her work and what she sells it for. He wanted to check out her resume and was hoping there was one that he could print out and keep on file. Jeff also wanted to see her artist statement. Jeff likes to have group shows based on the themes of artists work.
