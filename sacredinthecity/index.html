        	<p>The Shaman sees seeing as a creative act. How you see the world is a skill you can develop. We will work the skill of seeing from many angles in this class.</p>

			<p>As we learn we will be building a ceremonial offering. Working from the gut and heart we will jump right in, learn by doing, and trust our senses. In this space we are not working from the place of right and wrong, allowing people to experience and speak freely.</p>

			<p>We will explore the maps we use to navigate the world. We will look at How we hold the information we know about space, time, and the world we live in. We will look at where these maps work well and where they don’t. Has trying to decide yes or no ever stressed you out? The right and wrong framework can cause a lot of confusion and stress when applied to things that do not fit. Would you try to fit everything you own into your backpack? Differentiating what you need for each situation will give you freedom. Being able to shift between various maps makes negotiating the world much easier.</p>

			<p> We will look at ways that shaman map the world. The four directions, three centers and other maps will be shared. You will learn how to open sacred space, a method of shamanic breath work, and ways to work with altars.  To energize this understanding you will receive a Munay Ki rite. Kowak rites, the seer rites are beautiful rites that connect the vision of your eyes connected to the wisdom of your heart. Everyone will also go home with a sacred object charged with the energy of the evening. Afterwards there will be time for questions over tea.</p>

			<p>What to bring to class:
			It is traditional to give a small gift as an energy exchange when receiving a rite, something homemade, beeswax candles, or flowers are a good choices.</p>
