The Art of SeeingAn evening exploring the Shaman's way of seeing and mapping.The shaman sees seeing as a creative act. How you see the world is a skill you can develop. We will work the skill of seeing from many angles in this class.In this unique class format we will be building a ceremonial offering as we learn. ÊWorking from the gut and heart we will learn by doing. We will explore the maps we use to navigate the world. We will also be looking at ways that shaman map the world. You will learn how to open sacred space, a method of shamanic breath work, and ways work with alters. You will also participate in a group ceremony and receive the Kowak rights, the seer rights from the Munay Ki. In this beautiful right from the lineage of the Andies. Your vision is connected to the wisdom of your heart. Afterwards there will be time for questions over tea.Jenny Pipp is an artist-shaman-ceremonialist.
