Three: a lobbying group or political party (real or fake)
internet for dolphins.
A small group of dolphins and some of their human friends are lobbying to get regular internet access placed in various ocean locations. 
Special devices that read their sounds already have been developed for them to navigate and interact with the web.
The internet being a major point for news and global change is of interest to all dolphins, because what we do effects them. Being of a similar conciousness they demand that they can now be a part of the global conversation. They also want facebook pages, their human friends are tired of having to do all of their updates for them.
Internet should free to all!
